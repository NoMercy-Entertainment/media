00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.700
Excuse me?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.400
Excuse me, sir?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.900
Excuse me?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
Oh, come on.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
Do you have a moment, sir?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.450
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
Yes? Thank you.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.350
I've come a long way for you, Franck.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
My name is Victor.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Hi.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400
And you are....

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.900
You are Franck.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.400
You are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Oh yeah? How would you know?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.300
Look at you. You're an adventurer, Franck.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.400
Just like me, you're... a lone wolf.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Tell me, does one choose to be alone?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400
No, one doesn't.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.000
One doesn’t even choose to be a wolf.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400
Or does one?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.200
Well, mister... err... Hector.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.400
Victor. Victor.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.400
I don’t know what you’re on about but I'm just
a sheep minding its own business.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.000
And I suggest you do the same.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.400
No. No no no, Franck. Wait wait wait.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
No. This is not... the way.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.900
Just give me one minute of your precious time.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900
Precious time? Hehehe.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.900
Yeah just give me one minute.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.900
You would have one more minute, wouldn't you?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
Okay half. Half a minute.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.700
I knew it.
I knew it.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.400
You will not regret this.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.400
The adventures you will have.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.900
All the lives you've ever wanted.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.100
All you’ve been missing.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.400
Here. This is... the best product we have... in store.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400
Variable spin speed, excellent tumble performance...

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.400
...in one... handy... device. Squeaky clean.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.400
Well this... this better be good.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
Took me ages to tie that rope.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.400
With my fucking hooves.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400
No more need for hooves.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
No more sheepy business.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.900
Ho! Time flies.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.100
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.900
How does this thing work?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.400
I mean, how do I make it work?

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.900
No you don't.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.400
I just turned it on for you.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400
When can I go?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
Where can I go?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.400
We will pick you up. Don't worry, just stay here.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.400
In this exact place.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.400
Don't move. Just wait.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400
That's it?

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Hey!

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.400
Hey!

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.900
Wait, mister!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.300
Eh, Casper!

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.400
Hector whatever!
