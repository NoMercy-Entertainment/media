00:23.000 --> 00:24.500
You're a jerk, Thom.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;

00:27.000 --> 00:30.500
...you have your robotics, and I
just want to be awesome in space.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.000
Why don't you just admit that
you're freaked out by my robot hand?

00:34.500 --> 00:36.000
I'm not freaked out by- it's...

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
...alright! Fine!

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares
that I'm being chased...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
...by these giant robotic claws of death...

00:42.200 --> 00:45.000
"Fourty years later"
Whatever, Thom. We're done.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.500
Robot's memory synced and locked!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
This is pretty freaky.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Shouldn't you be down there?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I heard you guys talking last night.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It's not my fault, you know.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Are you ready?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
How's it looking, Barley?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
We should have about ten minutes...

03:21.500 --> 03:23.000
Well that's perfect.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.500
We're on in one! All systems go!
Yeah you, go!

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Go! Move your asses! Go go go!

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I love it! Come on, go!

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
That's nice.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.700
Nothing to worry about.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Thom.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
There she is.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.500
Now.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
You love her.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.500
She is your passion!

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Be tender to her.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.500
Be honest! Eh- be tender.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Remind her what love is.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
...and, action!

04:56.500 --> 04:58.000
Memory overwrite in progress!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You're a jerk, Thom!

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Look Celia.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
We have to follow our passions.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You have your robotics...

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
...and I just want to be awesome in space.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Speed it up, Thom!

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Vivacissimo!

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Why don't you just admit that you're
freaked out by my robot hand?

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Listen Celia, I was young...

05:59.500 --> 06:01.000
...and a dick.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
But that's no reason to
destroy the world.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Why does he do this?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
We already tried that one!

06:11.500 --> 06:12.500
Abort!

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Cut!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Whoaaa!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Whoaaa!

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Nooooo!

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You broke my heart.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I know.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
You forgot me on earth.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I know.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.000
I should just crush you.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm-

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm sorry.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Good ad-lib.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.500
Not my fault!

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
This time.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.500
Quiet on set!

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
We're out of time!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Come on!

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
RAAAAAAAAH!

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Memory overwrite, 90%.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Captain! We have to abort!

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
The world's changed, Celia...

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
...maybe we can too.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Memory overwrite complete!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
You know.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
There's a lesson to be learned from this.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Could'a gone worse.
